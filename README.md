# Capstone-project---EDA---AirBnb-Bookings-Analysis

**Description:**

This project analyzes Airbnb bookings data to gain insights into the trends and patterns of Airbnb use in New York City in 2019. The findings can be used by Airbnb hosts and guests to make informed decisions about where to list or book Airbnb properties.

**Objectives:**

* Understand the distribution of Airbnb listings based on their location, price range, room type, and other related factors.
* Identify popular neighborhoods and types of Airbnb listings.
* Analyze the relationship between Airbnb prices and occupancy rates.
* Identify seasonal trends in Airbnb bookings.
* Generate insights that can be used to improve the Airbnb experience for both hosts and guests.

**Methodology:**

The project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques to explore and visualize the Airbnb bookings data. EDA is a process of inspecting and cleaning data to identify patterns and trends.

The following Python libraries are used for the EDA:

* pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
* numpy: for numerical computing
* matplotlib: for data visualization
* seaborn: for statistical data visualization

**Results:**

The project findings include:

* The most popular neighborhoods for Airbnb listings in New York City are Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens.
* The most popular types of Airbnb listings are apartments, entire homes, and townhouses.
* There is a strong positive correlation between Airbnb prices and occupancy rates.
* Airbnb bookings are highest during the summer months and lowest during the winter months.

**Insights:**

The project findings provide valuable insights into the Airbnb market in New York City. Airbnb hosts can use these insights to make informed decisions about where to list their properties and how to price them. Airbnb guests can use these insights to make informed decisions about where to book their accommodations.

For example, Airbnb hosts in Manhattan may want to consider listing their properties in neighborhoods such as Greenwich Village, SoHo, or Tribeca, which are popular with tourists and business travelers. Airbnb hosts in Brooklyn may want to consider listing their properties in neighborhoods such as Williamsburg, Park Slope, or DUMBO, which are also popular with tourists and offer a more affordable option.

Airbnb guests who are looking for a centrally located and affordable accommodation may want to consider booking an Airbnb in Manhattan or Brooklyn. Airbnb guests who are looking for a more spacious and private accommodation may want to consider booking an Airbnb in an entire home or townhouse.

**Impact:**

The project findings can be used to improve the Airbnb experience for both hosts and guests. For example, Airbnb hosts can use the findings to optimize their pricing strategies and attract more guests. Airbnb guests can use the findings to find the best Airbnb accommodations for their needs and budget.

**Future Work:**

This project could be extended in a number of ways. For example, the analysis could be expanded to include data from other cities or countries. The analysis could also be used to develop predictive models that can help Airbnb hosts and guests make better decisions about Airbnb bookings.

**Conclusion:**

This project provides a valuable analysis of Airbnb bookings data in New York City. The findings can be used by Airbnb hosts and guests to make informed decisions about where to list or book Airbnb properties. The project could be extended in a number of ways to provide even more insights into the Airbnb market.
